Proposed Implementation - Project Scope

Calendar Functionality: 
    Display time blocks for specific activities and deadlines. 
    Allow users to add, edit, and delete time blocks. 
    
    For each time block, users can specify: 
        - Title 
        - Type of Activity 
        - Associated course/activity (if applicable) 
        - Duration 

Deadline Management: 
    Enable users to add, edit, and delete task deadlines. 
    
    For each deadline, users will input: 
        - Task name 
        - Due date 
        - Task complexity 

Task Prioritization: 
    Implement a sorting algorithm to prioritize tasks based on: 
        - Deadline proximity 
        - Task complexity 
        - Other relevant metrics (to be determined) 

User Interface: 
    Provide an intuitive, easy-to-navigate calendar interface. 
    Ensure smooth transitions between month, week, and day views. 
    
Data Persistence: 
    Store user data securely to maintain task and deadline information across sessions. 

Notification Pushes: 
    Notifications pushed to user daily based on upcoming deadlines and activities
